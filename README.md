# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Simulation Project

This project simulates the use of **Terraform** to provision Azure infrastructure. It includes a basic configuration to define an Azure Resource Group using the `azurerm` provider.

## 🔧 What’s Included

- `main.tf`: Simulated Terraform configuration.
- Simulated Azure CLI setup.
- Practice for real-world IaC projects using best practices.

## 🚀 Purpose

- Demonstrate understanding of Infrastructure as Code.
- Showcase Terraform skills in a DevOps/Azure Cloud portfolio.

## 🧪 Note

This is a **simulation project** for practice purposes. No real Azure resources are created unless applied with real credentials.

# Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Simulation with Terraform

This project simulates deploying Azure infrastructure using Terraform without actually provisioning any resources. It is intended for practice and portfolio demonstration purposes.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Terraform
- Azure CLI (simulated)
- Git & GitHub
- Bash (MINGW64)

## 📁 Files
- `main.tf`: Simulated Terraform configuration
- `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`: Simulated GitHub Actions workflow (optional)

## 🚀 Goal
To demonstrate understanding of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles and version control using Git and GitHub.

## 📸 Screenshot
(Add a screenshot of your terminal showing `terraform plan` if available.)

## 📚 Note
No actual Azure resources were deployed in this simulation.
